# IVRCameraMan-V2
Version 2.0 of the Insane Video Recorder - Camera Man

Insane Video Recorder (IVR) – Camera Man, is a code plug-in designed to help developers, artists and virtual production professionals produce videos in real time using Unreal, without the need to use a video production interface / UI for the creation of Cinematics.

For many years this type of professional, to get a video ready to be released, needs to use a UI to record their games first and use a series of other tools to cut and edit all frames of the video, as well as generating all the cinematics involved in the production.

With the evolution of Virtual Video Production methods, more and more such processes are no longer used, to make room for the generation of videos in real time, where the reproductive material is “Collected”, to be used in the production of the video.

Taking into account this evolution occurring in virtual production environments, the IVR Recorder was developed to allow these conceptual evolutions of virtual production to be available on Unreal Engine quickly and easily.

The name “Camera Man” was inspired in recording operations commanded by a Character that takes possession of the Player, just like in a Real Time Game!

The entire Plugin was developed in C ++ and the functionalities can be easily used in Blueprints, where instead of just specifying usage parameters, all the Plugin's usability was created to meet some "Use Cases", commonly used for recording videos.
